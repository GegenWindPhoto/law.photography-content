Model release contract example page

This page is an example Model release contract which grants both the photographer and the model usage rights for promotional purposes without seeking approval.

- Prior to publication the retouched images need to be approved by all parties.

_This clause tends to make a lot of sense when you're shooting with inexperienced models or models that want a lot of control over the images that are published of them. Being able to know that the final result needs to be approved before publication can allow both of you to shoot more freely._

- The images can be used on any digital or print platfom the individual parties deem appropriate.

_This means that nobody can say afterwards: Oh I don't want you to put that on Instagram or: You shouldn't use that picture in your CV, because usually I charge for that_

- All parties must be credited when ever possible at least once per publication

_This ensures that everybody on the shoot or doing work on your production gets credited, no matter if paid or not, to help them get recognition and future opportunities._

Examples:

- tag photographer or model on instagram
- link to the models preferred portfolio page, social media profile or own website
