Spain has a culture of appreciation for privacy and even though in areas with a lot of tourism most locals are more used to cameras, rural area residents will likely react defensively.

## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

No, if you take a picture of somebody in public, you will have to ask them for permission if they are recognisable. You can still shoot in public since you have a freedom of panorama, if photographing landscape or a building and they're _in the shot_. Actually shooting a street portrait will require permission.

The Spanish constitution, Section 18 reads as:

> The right to honour, to personal and family privacy and to the own image is guaranteed.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

No, you can not publish pictures of strangers without their consent.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

No, not for private or commercial purposes, you will need permission.

## Court Cases

- in **2015** a woman was fined 800â‚¬ for publishing a picture (including license plate) of an illegally parked police car. Source: [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/woman-fined-570-for-taking-photo-of-illegally-parked-police-car-in-spain-a2871376.html) This was possible due to a controversial law change that can prohibit photographing on duty police officers.
