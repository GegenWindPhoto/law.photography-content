## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

Yes.
If the person's legitimate interests are affected, you need consent though.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

Yes, if the person is not shown in a private situation and the picture is not used in a misleading or derogatory context or for publicity purposes. To determine whether legitimate interests are affected, context of the publication (e.g. text) can be taken into consideration.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

Yes, if the person is not shown in a private situation and the picture is not used in a misleading or derogatory context or for publicity purposes.

## Court Cases

**In 2013** the Supreme Court ruled that under certain circumstances even just taking photos of people can violate their general personality rights. Source:[RIS](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Justiz&Dokumentnummer=JJT_20130227_OGH0002_0060OB00256_12H0000_000)
