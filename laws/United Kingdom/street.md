The UK has some privacy relevant laws, but the laws for photography are generally permissive, which means that as long as you're in public, you can probably take the picture.

## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

Yes, you can almost without restrictions shoot anything as long as what you're seeing is visible from public property. You are allowed to shoot people, including police officers or other government officials.

Some exceptions will apply depending on which situation your subject is in. A court case for example showed a man in front of a drug rehab clinic, who sued against being depicted in this private moment.

Children are an exception to this rule, they have a stricter right to privacy.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

Yes, unless you show them in a vulnerable or very private situation, such as grieving, intoxicated, etc.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

Yes, you can also use the photos commercially.

## Can a Security Guard demand to see my camera or force me to delete my photo?

No, unless you're suspecting of preparing an act of terrorism. It is unclear what the legal threshold is for being under suspicion for that.
