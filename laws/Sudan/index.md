## All Photography Requires a Permit

In Sudan you'll need a formal permit for all kinds of photography. We assume this includes smartphones, drones, action cams and all kinds of photo and video equipment.

> All photography including on a camera phone requires a formal permit from the Ministry of Information. Donâ€™t take photographs close to government buildings, military installations, public utilities (including petrol stations), and other sensitive areas (bridges, airports). Many plain clothes public security officers operate across South Sudan. Two foreign nationals were followed, harassed and arrested by the authorities in Juba after photographing a petrol station.
