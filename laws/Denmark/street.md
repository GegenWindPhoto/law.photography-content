## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

Yes, you can almost without restrictions shoot anything as long as what you're seeing is visible from public property. You are allowed to shoot people, including police officers or other government officials.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

Yes, if they are not the primary subject or clearly recognizable.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

Yes, if the primary subject is not clearly recognizable as an individual.

## Can a security guard demand to see my camera or force me to delete my photo?

No. Not even the Police is allowed to do that unless you have been taking the photo on private or government property. You will have to be pursued legally if you're breaking house rules, but you can not be forced to delete footage.
