Photographing people and publishing the images is only very vaguely regulated.

## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

Yes, you can almost without restrictions shoot anything as long as what you're seeing is visible from public property.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

Yes, if they are not the primary subject and the photo does not cause damage, suffering or despise to the person in the picture.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

Commercial use follows the same rules as non-commercial use, unless it is promotional (in advertisement or similar). For promotional use, consent is required.
