## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

Yes, you can. Taking pictures of strangers does not require consent unless they have actively revoked it or clearly signaled that they do not want their picture taken.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

Maybe. Portraits of strangers do require consent unless they are a figure of public interest like a politician or a celebrity. Otherwise, you will need their permission to publish their portrait.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

If the street photo is a portrait, you will need their consent, most commonly in the shape of a model release.

We could not find any precedence of art being sold, because in other countries there is a distinction between a sale as art and commercial usage in marketing.

## Can anyone demand to see my camera or force me to delete my photo?

No, as in most countries, law enforcement may seize your equiptment if you're under arrest, but not just force you to delete any footage.

## Relevant Laws

The relevant laws, like in other european countries are the freedom of panorama and the GDPR.
