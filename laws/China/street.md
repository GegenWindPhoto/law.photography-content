China in the following is the People's Republic of China (mainland China and Hong Kong, not Taiwan).

## Can I Shoot Footage in Public without Consent?

Yes, you can shoot photos of individuals without consent.

## Can I publish Photos taken of Strangers without Consent?

You can publish photos of individuals, even if recognisable, without consent.

An exception for **Hong Kong** can be made if one party, for example the photographer, is compiling identifyable information such as photos of another specific individual or cataloguing several individuals with intent.

This means that art should be fine to publish, but a list of people including their pictures documenting their whereabouts, would not.

## Can I use Street Photos commercially?

No, you can not use photos of people that are not relevant to the public, such as celebrities, to commercially benefit. If you're going to sell pictures or to use identifyable people on the street in an advertisement campaign, remember to bring your model release forms.

Editorial use also seems to be possible for commercial use without consent, Source: [Data Protection Principles, Page 21](https://www.pcpd.org.hk/tc_chi/publications/files/Perspective_2nd.pdf)
